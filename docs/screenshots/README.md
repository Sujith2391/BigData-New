## Screenshot Checklist

Place your evidence screenshots in this directory before submitting the assignment. Suggested captures:

1. **Setup script output** – terminal log from `npm run setup` followed by `npm run seed`.
2. **CRUD demo** – Postman or browser window showing a successful `POST /api/students` and the returned JSON.
3. **Query with range + sort** – `GET /api/students?minMarks=80&sort=desc` response.
4. **Aggregation results** – Console output from `npm run analytics` or the `/api/analytics/average-by-semester` endpoint.

Name the files clearly (e.g., `01-setup.png`, `02-create.png`). Update `README.md` with file names if they differ.
